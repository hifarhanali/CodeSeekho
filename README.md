# CodeSeekho
Treat Your Code the Way You Want Other's Code to Treat You

## Inspiration
Sometimes, beginners and more specifically students need a kind of mentorship and industry experience on how to write a code that is scalable and maintainable at a big level. To overcome this issue, we have developed an online website that can help students to get verify/review their code from experienced individuals.

## What it does
CodeSeekho is an online platform that can help individuals including both students and professionals to improve their coding skills. It reduces the distance between the students and industry professionals. Students can post their code on CodeSeekho and their code snippet will be reviewed by the industry professionals and senior students.

## How we built it
We have used Next JS, a react framework, along with Typescript as our technology stack. We have used Postgresql as our database to store information. Additionally, Prisma ORM is used to reduce the complexities in dealing with the database.

## Challenges we ran into
While working with the database, we realized we need to change the schema of our website. We have to pass through the phase of database migration to ensure an updated version of the database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we have developed a full-stack with modern frameworks within 24 hours. We have not built an application, we have to build a tool that can be useful in reducing the distance between academia and industry.

## What we learned
There are a lot of things we have learned throughout this Hackathon and project development. While developing this app, we have worked with PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM and this is the first time we are using these frameworks. We have learned how to work in a team, collaborate on GitHub, manage the project within such a short deadline, etc. The most important thing I like is the brainstorming session. During these brainstorming sessions, we first storm, collect ideas in quantity, and then calm, and filter quality ideas.

## What's next for CodeSeekho
Within this 24 hours development journey, we have built an MVP(Minimum Viable Product) that can help students to improve their code. The next step in this journey is to improve the website's structure to make it both scalable and manageable in the future. Furthermore, there are a lot of use cases that we can incorporate to improve the business model.
